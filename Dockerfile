# Bulk RNA-seq container image.
#
# Single image for three use cases, selected by the first CMD arg:
#   init     → interactive config generator (workflow/scripts/init_project.py)
#   jupyter  → JupyterLab server on port 8888 for notebooks/explore.ipynb
#   default  → Snakemake pipeline (any extra args forwarded to snakemake)
#
# The R/Bioconductor stack that notebooks read is baked into the base env
# so the Jupyter use case is zero-setup. Pipeline rules still resolve their
# own conda envs under workflow/envs/*.yaml via --use-conda on first run
# (cached in .snakemake/conda/ on the bind-mounted project directory).
#
# Build (single arch, local):
#   docker build -t bulk-rnaseq:latest .
#
# Build (multi-arch, requires buildx):
#   docker buildx create --use
#   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
#       -t bulk-rnaseq:latest --load .
#
# Run examples (bind-mount project at /project):
#   docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/project bulk-rnaseq init
#   docker run --rm    -v "$PWD":/project bulk-rnaseq --configfile config/config.yaml --cores all
#   docker run --rm    -v "$PWD":/project -p 8888:8888 bulk-rnaseq jupyter
#
# The entrypoint (docker/entrypoint.sh) picks up the host UID/GID from
# /project's ownership and switches to it via gosu, and sets HOME=/tmp so
# conda/mamba/jupyter have a writable cache. No `-u` or `-e HOME=/tmp` needed.
