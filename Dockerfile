# Bulk RNA-seq downstream pipeline — container image.
#
# Multi-arch: linux/amd64 + linux/arm64 (Apple Silicon).
# Per-rule R/Python envs under workflow/envs/*.yaml are created by Snakemake
# on first run (--use-conda); they live in .snakemake/conda/ on the mounted
# project directory and are reused across runs.
#
# Build (single arch, local):
#   docker build -t bulk-rnaseq:latest .
#
# Build (multi-arch, requires buildx):
#   docker buildx create --use
#   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
#       -t bulk-rnaseq:latest --load .
#
# Run (bind-mount project at /project, pass snakemake args as CMD):
#   docker run --rm \
#       -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
#       -e HOME=/tmp \
#       -v "$PWD":/project \
#       bulk-rnaseq -c1
#
#   The -u/-e HOME flags are not optional:
#     -u $(id -u):$(id -g)  → make outputs in .snakemake/ and results/ owned
#                              by the host user (avoid root-owned files).
#     -e HOME=/tmp          → conda/mamba need a writable HOME for cache;
#                              the image's mambauser HOME is not writable when
#                              the user is overridden.
